Nelson Ray's PhD thesis
Using .tex, .sty files and structure from Patrick Perry's thesis: git://github.com/patperry/thesis.git

# Thesis Schedule
For the remainder of the thesis, I'll adopt a breadth-first strategy: first lay down as much of the framework as possible in generality, fill in the missing gaps, and finally polish up.

## Thesis Plan
### Short Term
* ~~put up copy + paste of Friedman Test chapter from NIPS paper (due 10/28/2012)~~
* ~~include skeleton of multiple kernel learning chapter (due 10/28/2012)~~
* get Nike and Sourav's comments on Stein's Method chapters (fall quarter) (Nike is traveling until the end of October and will be with a visitor in early November; she will be available mid November)
* rewrite, re-organize, and flesh out Friedman Test chapter (due 11/7/2012)
* make code for Friedman Test chapter nicer and allow for easy plot generation (due 11/14/2012)
* rewrite, re-organize, and flesh out MKL chapter (due 11/21/2012, split Thanksgiving)
* make code for MKL chapter nicer and allow for easy plot generation (due 11/28/2012, split Thanksgiving) 
* include real data (wine data) MKL example (due 12/5/2012)

### Medium Term
* add more substance and examples to FT and MKL chapters (11/2012 - 12/2012)
* finish first draft of thesis (due 1/6/2013)
* tidy up code + plots to allow for rapid iteration (ongoing)

### Long Term
* get committee's feedback (winter quarter) and address it
* meet with the Hume Writing Center (60 minute sessions for thesis consultation, can make continuing appointments, can schedule up to 2 weeks in advance) for writing advice
